I have a VPS. It runs Debian stable. I use it for a lot of things. This documentation is as much about what the point of having my own VPS is as much as it is about the software I use to implement it.

My motivation behind building all of this is similar to that of the [FreedomBox](http://freedomboxfoundation.org/) except half of it lives in a datacenter in Manchester rather than my living room.

Ultimately I'm planning to get all of this madness turned into a fabric/chef/puppet/cfengine3 script. Probably as a fork of [Nick Daly's plug server setup scripts](https://bitbucket.org/nickdaly/plugserver). (Which is by the far most useful bit of work to come out of the FreedomBox mailing-list so far.)

## SSL

I have an actual CA signed SSL cert from namecheap.com which most of my services use. The convenience of not fighting with self-signed certs clients with dodgy SSL implementations is totally worth the ~Â£6/year.

## E-mail

I host my own e-mail. I used to use Gmail but Gmail has an awful IMAP implementation and these days search is weirdly slow. Plus you know, privacy is good right?

### [exim4](http://www.exim.org/)

Pretty much the standard Debian single file exim configuration. I've enabled DKIM and SpamAssasin and have a valid SPF record in DNS. Getting the config for this to actually work was a bit of a pain because debugging exim is a bit of a black art.

### [Dovecot](http://www.dovecot.org/)

I recently switched from Cyrus to Dovecot. It's a lot faster for my use.

The configuration is pretty much exactly what you get from the Debian package but with plaintext IMAP disabled entirely.

## Instant Messaging

[Prosdy](http://prosody.im/). ejabberd is way too complicated for this use-case.

## IRC

irssi in GNU screen.

## Home Theatre Tunnel

I have a home server. I don't particularly want to expose it directly to the internet because I have limited upstream bandwidth and it's generally a bit slow. So I use [vtund](http://vtun.sourceforge.net/), iptables and a [Varnish](https://www.varnish-cache.org/) cache to control and limit it's exposure to the interwebs.

### Media streaming

Obviously there's lots of awesome music and videos on this thing. If I'm going to hoard them all I might as well make them easy to use too. 

I run a varnish instance that proxies several HTTP services from the HTPC to the internet. Media streaming is done through [Subsonic](http://www.subsonic.org/). This gives me real-time transcoding and streaming of video to my browser or mobile phone from my home. It's like having a private NetFlix and Spotify server rolled into one. Sadly it doesn't support HTML5 video/audio yet so I have to endure Flash :(

I started off using Squid and it worked rather nicely but well, everything in [this](https://www.varnish-cache.org/trac/wiki/ArchitectNotes) is pretty true. So I switched. I run the 3.0.2+streaming branch of Varnish so that the large media files and my HTPCs slowish upload speed don't make the whole experience unusable. This requires you to modify the varnish config to work too! The magic sauce is the beresp.do_stream option in vcl_fetch.
